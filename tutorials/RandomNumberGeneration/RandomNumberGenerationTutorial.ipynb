    "# Quantum Random Number Generation Algorithm Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "True random number generation is a notoriously difficult problem. Many \"random\" generators today are actually pseudorandom, using a starting seed to spawning seemingly-random numbers that are actually a repeatable function of that seed. Most true random number generations are based on measurements of some natural phenomenon, such as atmospheric noise or atomic decay. (You can read more about it [here]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation\n",
    ").) Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) are truly random. The quantum algorithm for random number generation is a simple application of quantum gates that only requires as many qubits as one would need bits to store the numbers being produced.\n",

    "In this tutorial you will:\n",
    "* learn about random number generation and the principles behind quantum random number generation,\n",
    "* implement a QRNG with equal probability of any given number,\n",
    "* and implement a single-bit QRNG with weighted probabilities.\n",
